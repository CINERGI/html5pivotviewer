June 04 2014, V?.??.?:

 * Added new examples
 * Added batch file to make pivotviewer.js on Windows
 * Added support for multiple areas plotted on a map
    Each item can have an associated area which is shown on the
    map once the item has been selected.
 * Added the option to add WMS overlay to the map.
    The base url of the WMS server is supplied without the bbox option
    when calling PivotViewer. e.g.
    MapOverlay: http://maps.communities.gov.uk:8080/geoserver/eafloodareas/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetMap&layers=FloodAlertsWarnings&styles=&srs=EPSG:4326&format=image%2Fjpeg
 * Mapview will now display geometries
    You can now specify a geometry in a specially
    named facet using WKT and it is displayed on the
    map
 * Added support for maps using OpenStreetMap as well as Google maps.
 * Added grouping items in mapview using colored pins
 * Added timeline view.
 * Fixed bug in sorting
    If a facet category was marked as wordwheelvisible but not filtervisible
    then a search term in that category would not be found.
 * Added filtering using a custom date range
 * Improved handling of datetime data
    now possible to filter based on time periods rather
    than matching an exact date time.
